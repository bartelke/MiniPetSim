THIS IS SMALL SIMULATION THAT WAS MADE ONLY TO SHOW USAGE OF INTERFACE AND ABSTRACT CLASS

You have 600 amounts of food. Your pets are: a duck, a dog, a cat and a bird. You have to feed them. Every 7 rounds you will get extra 500 amounts of food. Any pet can't starve more than 2 rounds. Be careful to not overfeed anyone too!
